# Roblox Fast Donation Button Creation [Beta]
A free Roblox plugin to allow easy creation of donation buttons in your game. Also works for shirts, pants and models.

Created by GamersInternational and the Rii-built Studios team.

Please submit pull requests if you want to help make the plugin better, pull requests that use Rojo will be denied as I want to make sure that anyone with a little coding knowledge can access the code. Donate Robux to help support me push out more updates: https://www.roblox.com/games/6010987912
